    <p>Problem Statement: Student Record Management
You are given data about students in a college.
 Create a program using JavaScript Objects that performs the following tasks step by step:
Create an object named student with properties:
 name, age, course, and marks.


Add a new property grade and modify the marks value.


Use Object.keys() and Object.values() to display all property names and their values separately.


Use Object.entries() to print keyâ€“value pairs together in array format.


Create another object extraDetails with properties like city and rollNo,
 and merge it into the student object using Object.assign().


Use Object.hasOwnProperty() to check if the student object has the property course and address.


Make a copy of the student object and apply Object.freeze() on it.
 Try adding or modifying properties and observe that no changes happen.


Apply Object.seal() on another copy of the object and verify that:


You cannot add or delete properties,


But you can modify existing values.


ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
By the end, your program should demonstrate:
Creation and modification of objects


Use of all major Object methods (keys, values, entries, assign, hasOwnProperty, freeze, seal)


Understanding the difference between frozen and sealed objects
